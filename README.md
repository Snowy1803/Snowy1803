### Programming Languages

The main languages I use are **Swift**, **C** and **C++**. I've made a lot of projects with them and I've mastered them.  
I also have some experience with **Java**, **Python**, **Rust**, **Haskell**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **Objective-C**, **bash scripting**, **LLVM IR**, and of course my own programming languages (EK, GRPH, Glu).  
I love learning languages, and have also tried Golang, C#, Perl, Clojure, Kotlin, Scala and Agda, among others.
