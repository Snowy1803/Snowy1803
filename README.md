### Programming languages

My main languages are **Swift**, **C** and **C++**. I've made a lot of projects with them, and I master them completely.  
I also have some experience with **Java**, **Python**, **Rust**, **Haskell**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **Objective-C**, **bash scripting**, **LLVM IR**, and of course my own programming languages.  
I love learning languages, and have also tried Golang, C#, Perl, Clojure, Kotlin and Scala.

Currently, I am mostly writing C and C++ for school projects.
